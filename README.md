# vela-finance-emulate

We are trying to emulate Pienso.com homepage.  The page has a full bright green background. Overlaid on the background is a white rectangular section that takes up the majority of the page vertically, with some green still visible above and below it. This white section contains the main headline, description text, and 3D graphic. The company logo should read "Vela" displayed in the top left corner, along with navigation links for "About", "Blog" and "Our Companies" in the top right.
The main headline should read "Pushing the boundaries of Finance and AI." In the footer please include links to Terms and Conditions alongside Privacy Policy. Additionally add links to X and Telegram.
